Take a peek from up above,
Exercise your endless love,

For the money and the rich,
Save them when they're in the ditch,

For the guns and endless war,
Blood and death make earth's best lore,

For silencing the opressed,
Calm and quiet should be blessed,

Tell your disciples "good work",
Such great job raising pitchforks,

Don't mind all the suffering,
It's worth it for the ending,

Those who die, just skip ahead,
Must vanish to afford bread.
