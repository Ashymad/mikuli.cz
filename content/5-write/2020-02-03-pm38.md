Waves slowly walk the empty,  
unchanged bliss of the river,  
the presence of the water,  
fills souls nearby with calm  

feelings and flowy peace,  
unravels knots of thoughts.  
Serene blanket falls upon,  
our weary, stiffened shoulders.  

Quietness of the sand,  
sleepily takes away,  
moments of happiness,  
to gather on the shore
