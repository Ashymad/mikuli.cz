Today's the day,  
my Earth turns for,  
one final time,  
this sunny May.  

Wound paths led here,  
paved with longing,  
for turns of fate,  
that felt so dear.  

All left behind,  
memories back home,  
in lonely wait,  
for dust to find.  

The few steps more,  
of tired legs,  
some foggy thoughts,  
felt like a chore.  

Not gonna say,  
a single "bye",  
just disappear,  
this sunny May.
