Sometimes I feel,  
like nothing's lost,  
like every day,  
I like the most  

And when I walk,  
I feel my feet,  
down on the ground,  
the soil they meet  

And when I breathe,  
the air comes in,  
and feels my lungs,  
up to the brim  

And where I look,  
there's something new,  
that keeps myself,  
from missing you
