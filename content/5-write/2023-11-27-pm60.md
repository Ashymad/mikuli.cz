I thought the recipe,  
For a happy human,  
Can be read easily,  
Help from a librarian,  
I'll be served with the book,  
Listing the ingredients,  
Then with a passing look,  
I'll note the expedients,  
That must be collected,  
I'll note the exact steps,  
That must be adopted,  
In the daily subjects,  
Of the people I love,  
That I wish I could make,  
Happiness from the stove,  
Purpose of life I'd bake  

Like a layered sponge cake
