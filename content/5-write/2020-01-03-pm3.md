I told the flow of time,  
to slow down for a while,  
to give me a chance,  
to think  

I need just a bit more,  
to leer into my core,  
to force emotions,  
to shrink  

So I can make a plan,  
to not be overrun,  
to stop my mind's urge,  
to sink  

Day ends, life's seas I've swum  
to end, until I've come  
to it, took the time,  
to blink
