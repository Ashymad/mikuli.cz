Do not stare into the infinite light,  
Open the window not, too bright, too bright...  
As feet unravel soil beneath the soles,  
Let worms arise, creeping through the pores,  
Flat endless ceiling up overhead,  
Unbounded vastness, should be instead  
Understandable  

Rage, rage against the dying of the mind
