You open eyes,  
slowly,  

You look around,  
sharply,  

But you cannot  
find it  

Imagine it,  
clearly  

How does it look,  
to you?  

Does it feel warm,  
cozy?  

Or is it cold,  
scary?  

Or gray, empty,  
unchanged?  

Take a few steps,  
towards  

Or maybe you,  
shouldn't  

You don't want to  
spoil it
