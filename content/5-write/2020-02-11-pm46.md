I wish i had a way  
To love you how I should,  
Like sun, ending the day,  
covered with pink cloud hood  

I wish i had a word,  
That tells you how i feel,  
Like memory safely stored,  
Remembered often still  

I wish i've been through fights,  
To reach out to your soul,  
Like star's last dying lights,  
Escaping a black hole  

But no instead I got,  
The best person there is,  
Someone I love a lot,  
Who's words just do not miss
