Tuk-tuk, tuk-tuk,  
the wheels of steel,  
familiar sound,  
that makes me heal.  

Trees quickly flow,  
outside the glass,  
and with them too,  
my past shall pass.  

I leave my home,  
to silent plants,  
watered by ghosts,  
time to make plans.  

I'll change myself,  
I'll find my way,  
I'll meet someone,  
or so I pray  

Tuk-tuk, tuk-pssh,  
train stops, I'm here,  
new, happy life  
is surely near  

In queue behind,  
waits pasenger,  
strangely see-through,  
while plants wither
