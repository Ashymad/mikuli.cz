Sometimes the day just starts,  
and on it goes and goes,  
just like the one before,  
nor fun nor full of woes  

The trap has closed it's teeth,  
you can't escape no more,  
tomorrow feels the same,  
what are you waiting for  

And then there's a day  
when everything goes well,  
you try and you succeed,  
might you escape this helll?  

But deep inside you know,  
that hell cannot be seen,  
in life out there, instead  
it follows you, within
