I loathe that even though,  
I try so hard sometimes,  
some think it's just for show,  
TODO: make sure it rhymes  

Sad sentence: oh how I,  
tried once and failed (oh my),  
this verse make rhyme 2-2,  
find word to change "try" to  

Too lazy to write 4,  
this time settle with 3,  
longwinded means long-bored,  
"to be or not to be"
