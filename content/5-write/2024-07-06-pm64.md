Don't you feel that tug inside?  
Rope as long as the car ride,  
That you father took you on,  
To forget all that is gone,  
One end - wrapped around your throat,  
And the other? From a boat,  
Dropped into the deepest bay,  
Keeps just falling everyday,  
One day it will find it's goal,  
You'll be with it if you stall,  
I'll be one of the creatures,  
Gnawing upon your features,  
Belive me, it won't be long,  
Before you're where you belong.
