There is a human-shaped hole,  
in the space of my home.  
I look at it, questioning "why?",  
it doesn't look, it has no eyes,  
I try to move the space around,  
to hide the hole in the background,  
of busy work and daily chores,  
arranging socks in the drawers,  
ignoring what's painfully true,  
it can be filled only by you.
