How do you answer when someone asks,  
"When will we see the end of the dusk?",  
"What if our children come to the world,  
and from the birth day have to be old?"  

Your mind gets blank, and you turn around,  
check if an escape is to be found,  
in one of the cracks in that one tile,  
on kitchen's wall, you took a long while,  
to place correctly, and had to file,  
for it to fit well and look just right,  
and then a crack appeared overnight,  
imagine my massive frustration!  

"Anyway, how's your renovation?"
