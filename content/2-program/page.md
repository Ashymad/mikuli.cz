I create software. Not only at work. Currently I am working on a playback
synchronization software to enable distributed Wave Field Synthesis system
creation with Raspberry Pis. You can find everything that I create on my
[github](https://github.com/Ashymad) and mirrored [here](https://git.5hy.men).
