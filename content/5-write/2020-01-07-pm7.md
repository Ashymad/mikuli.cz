The dark has come,  
slowly,  
but surely,  
encroaching  

I cannot see,  
my eyes,  
succumbed to  
the sadness  

Towards the light!  
I hear  
a voice of  
my reason  

There is no light.  
Responds,  
despairing,  
broken heart  

Life chugs along,  
unstopped,  
goals are set,  
but joy lost  

I stand and fight,  
proudly,  
inside fear  
takes over  

The dark had come,  
I've lost,  
my lungs filled,  
mind shattered
