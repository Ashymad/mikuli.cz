There was a happy land,  
far, far, away,  
pink castle there did stand,  
of ballons made  

It squaked and bent walked on,  
towers toppled,  
It had a pit glued on,  
by fun balls filled  

One day a message came,  
from next country,  
to happy land kings name,  
addresed bluntly  

King tried to open soon,  
with trusty knife,  
It fell, ballons went boom  
everyone died
