Slithering lines of darkness,  
slowly flow down your back,  
your eyes now a bit hazy,  
though still ready to attack  

Swift movements of your muscles,  
now but a memory,  
your prey so terrified once,  
now sleeps without a worry  

Locomotive of your life,  
is near its final stop,  
though with might of the engine,  
steam roars out from chimneys top  

The power that lays within,  
can heal, bring joy, fix heart,  
the flame of fiery soul,  
will burn right until we part
