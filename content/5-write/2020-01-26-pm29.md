And soon the clouds begin to show,  
The shade covers the ground,  
And through your ears they slowly flow,  
Your smile cannot be found  

The storm outside is gone for days,  
But here inside our place,  
The happy sun's warm shining rays,  
Are scared to touch your face  

I try to navigate the sea,  
of tears cried out of sight,  
I want you to believe in me,  
it's gonna be allright
