Sometimes I design logos. Usually I create them in Inkscape. Here are the polished ones:

[shop](https://rosa.robi.to) (website also made by me)


<img width="300" src="/media/images/LabAcousticsAGH_grad.svg"><br>
A logo for a scientific circle founded by my friend, based on her drawings.
Currently used on its [website](http://labacoustics.agh.edu.pl) (website also
made by me). Has a small version:

[facebook](https://facebook.com/LabAcoustics).

A personal logo, currently not in use.


<img width="200" src="/media/images/STfull.svg"><br>
A fun logo for an imaginary company competing with [SVANTEK](https://svantek.com). Has a small version: <img width="10" src="/media/images/ST.svg">. Not used.


<img width="170" src="/media/images/ACL.svg"><br>
A logo originally meant as a gift for the good people at [ACL](https://acloserlisten.com/), but I don't find it fitting enough. Not used.
