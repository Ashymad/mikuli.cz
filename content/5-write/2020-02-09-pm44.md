You don't do love the ordinary way,  
instead you put your heart up on display,  
with every beat droplets of care pour off,  
envelop me like cozy winter cloth.  

I imagine your voice on lonely days,  
feel of your fingers drawing on my face,  
weight of your body up against my own,  
you're here with me even if I'm alone.  

But then, you're back laughing again with me,  
you find a way to convince me to see,  
the world as pretty and that's why I say,  
you don't do love the ordinary way.
