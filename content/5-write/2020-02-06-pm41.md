The leaves around whisper softly,  
The road upfront winds left and right,  
The crickets call their mates loudly,  
The mountains look down from their height  

The crows laugh with their riddled eyes,  
The dogs scavenge for skimpy meals,  
The forest, tired, gently sighs,  
The skin is full of tangly feels  

One step after another I,  
swallowed by leafy trees in whole,  
am saying my final goodbye,  
spent daily playing human role
