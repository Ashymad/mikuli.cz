Air of sharpness cuts my throat,  
As I look out from the boat,  
At the life I left behind,  
If I only were more kind,  
To the voice that did not stop,  
Talking "Land's close just hop, just hop"  
But that's not what I did, could not,  
Crush souls so full of love,  
Burn bridges on my stove,  
I squashed the voice inside,  
And found a place to hide,  
My dreams of cheery smile,  
Without wanting to die
