The Sun shines bright,  
just like your smile,  
it spreads the warmth,  
makes life worthwhile.  

The Sun burns hot,  
just like your soul,  
it doesn't stop,  
before its goal.  

The Sun took form,  
in harsh dark space,  
like you had borne,  
past left a trace.  

The Sun loves all,  
like you brings joys,  
grownups feel small,  
play with their toys.  

For you I'll fight,  
I will not run,  
Life has no night,  
with you, my Sun.
