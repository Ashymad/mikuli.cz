I know you hear the word a lot,  
I know that enough it is not,  
And there's not much I can say,  
To make all things I've done OK  

I want to tell you how I felt,  
I saw your smile begins to melt,  
And though it pained me to the core,  
I know I must have hurt you more  

I blabber on, stop thinking and  
I'd rather my mouth would just end,  
Completely block sentences that,  
Could make your heart feel really bad  

And though I say this word a lot,  
I mean it in my every thought,  
I add your pain to our story,  
For every time I'm so sorry
