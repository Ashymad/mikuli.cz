It's empty without you around,  
never knew, how i'd miss the sound,  
of your breath next to me in bed,  
of my lips touching your forehead  

Every morning I reach to find,  
dreams not yet having left my mind,  
your hair, your hand, your face, your scent,  
but dreams, still being dreams, I can't  

Vice clamped firmly around my heart,  
keeps getting tighter from the start,  
of moments when you can't be found,  
it's empty without you around
