Rain plays its rhythm slowly,  
the sky is gray and bland,  
and soon the night will wander in,  
tuck in this sleepy land  

Through windows, closed, but napping,  
intruder tries to slip,  
a bit of afternoons wet air,  
"come out", whispers, "don't weep"  

"But", "Stop, don't linger longer",  
"Now, breathe in deep and slow",  
"Smell it? The smell of empty streets",  
it makes me want to go  

I step outside, say goodbyes,  
by mist in whole swallowed,  
"my home is here no more my love",  
"I'm off", steps died, wind howled  

Rain plays its rhythm slowly,  
no stars on blackest sky,  
but soon the day will shine it's light,  
unveil if I still cry
