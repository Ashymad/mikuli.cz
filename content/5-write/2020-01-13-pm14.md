And so the story begins,  
without a faintest of sound,  
hidden between the trees,  
waiting just to be found  

Its letters sprout out and grow,  
from pages of soil and rot,  
together words they form,  
that bloom led by sun's plot  

And when the time is just right,  
sentences are born of bloom,  
they bring inside a flesh  
of meaning to consume  

Now bite deep inside the fruit,  
absorb the story in whole  
you'll be left with a seed,  
to plant in other's soul
