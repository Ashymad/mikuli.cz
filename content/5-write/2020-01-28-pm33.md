There is that time, after the rain,  
just stopped or took a break,  
like that calm feeling on a train,  
when view keeps eyes awake  

The evening air after the day,  
so hot it tired you out,  
a moment when all floats away,  
you're left to stroll about  

The soothing wind embraces you,  
a wave, on empty sea,  
and stops others from crossing through,  
your path,  
your mind,  
you're free
