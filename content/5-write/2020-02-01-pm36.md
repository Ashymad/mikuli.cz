A quiet sound of wooden door  
opening, filled the room,  
I glanced back there, just to be shure,  
the guest brought not my doom,  

but warm feelings and happy smile,  
cause it's one of these days,  
when simple hug, missed for a while,  
is such a saving grace  

"Welcome my friend, It's been so long,  
since i have seen your face,  
Coffee? Tea? I'll put on a song,  
here, please take up my place" -  

\- i fussed around, while my housemates,  
all went out for a walk,  
Anger, Fear, Pain and Loneliness,  
we made a deal,  
tonight's my turn,  
I get to talk and talk...
