With every day the future fades,  
Eventually it disappears,  
The splitting crossroads of life's ways,  
Now all lead through my deepest fears,  

One day I thought I had it all,  
The world looked like a food buffet,  
And with whatever I could roll,  
And there was always the next day,  

Now fingers on my hands can count,  
The moments I have here to spend,  
Before I will be laying found,  
no breath, still heart, and pronounced dead
