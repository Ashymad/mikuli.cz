A blip of static, eerie sound,  
my screen protrudes out of the ground,  
my picture shows hard pangs of pain,  
tightly packed souls riding a train,  

next station: hell, where everyone,  
is welcome to have so much fun,  
thinking is what they did before,  
here they are free, free to ignore,  

ignore the hate their actions bear,  
ignore the torture people share,  
ignore the ones who's life is real,  
Ignore the guilt that'll never heal
