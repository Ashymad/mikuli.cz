Sandy, gritty, empty, vast  
Full of memories of the past  
Lost to time and lost to space  
Seen before yet unknown place  

Branches, thorns, roots, maybe leaves,  
Covering each spot that gives,  
Full of life and of decay,  
Eat leftovers, soak up day  

Rusty, moldy, broken down,  
Sometimes blue but mostly brown,  
Used to work and used to play  
Daily duties couldn't stay  

Worried, stubborn, dead but free  
To walk miles or not to be,  
How to think and how to breathe,  
Body is becoming stiff  

Circling, gawking, hungry growl,  
Sand collapses like a bowl,  
One with you and one with me,  
Look around it's plain to see
