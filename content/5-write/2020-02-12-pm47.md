The car backseat,  
looked eagerly,  
at hands that meet,  
touch-talk sultry  

It screamed "Just stop!  
What is the rush?  
Feel how your hot  
nude bodies clash"  

Urge so, so strong,  
our bodies led,  
we stopped, far long,  
before our bed  

I threw you down,  
your begging face,  
had made me drown,  
in your embrace  

A touch of yours,  
felt like 10 amp,  
your heart - the source,  
my groin - the lamp  

And when the circuit,  
finally closed,  
I coudn't stop it,  
the current flowed
