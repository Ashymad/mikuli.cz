Here is a note,  
to everyone,  
I swiftly wrote,  
for my loved one  

I cannot stress,  
this strong enough,  
she is the best,  
she makes me laugh  

Look out for when,  
she is around,  
smile at her, then,  
fun is abound  

Also beware,  
cause she is sly,  
no man was there,  
her wit who'd try  

I hope you see,  
a note can't fit,  
how dear to me,  
she is, can it?  

P.S. Won't lie,  
world's end comes, then,  
I'm gonna die,  
a happy man
