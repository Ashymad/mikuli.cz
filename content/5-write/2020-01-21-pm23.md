A wave of time  
erodes the shore,  
just on a whime  
you know no more  

of past mistakes,  
of past amends,  
of what still aches,  
of long lost friends.  

may just it be,  
until today,  
you lived not here,  
but years away.  

the time has let  
your mind to flee,  
today you're set  
finally free.
