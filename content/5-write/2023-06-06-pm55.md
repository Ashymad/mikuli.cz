My blood starts to boil hot,  
I can look away not,  
My breath starts escaping,  
A fury,  
I am emanating,  

While people would rather,  
Say plan is apparent,  
What should realize will,  
Than fight it,  
Spew the destiny pill  

The quarks won't reverse spin,  
To bring to you your dream,  
Don't dare make me annoyed,  
When I go,  
Screaming into the void
