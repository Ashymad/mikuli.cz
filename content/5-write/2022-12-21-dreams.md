Some dreams are big -  
vast, like the void in outer space,  
they want to change the fabric of,  
bring each and every part in the right place,  
so that it all unfolds,  
few, special days  

Some dreams are small -  
plain, like specks of dust on your floor,  
they want to broom away for once,  
bring each and every grain out of the door,  
so that you can just rest,  
and smile some more.
