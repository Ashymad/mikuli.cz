Walk outside ,  
swim the sea of people,  
meet and talk  

Through the door,  
from crowded city streets  
noise and booze  

Beautiful,  
sit beside her for once,  
so they say  

Mouth open,  
but it doesn't make a sound,  
what to say?  

Hand reaches  
but it doesn't want to touch  
a stranger  

How can I?  
If I cannot do it  
In my head
