The fluffy strands of flowing clouds  
attract me to the skies above.  
I want to bounce up on these mounds  
of water cotton weaved with love,  

by nature's gentle weary hands,  
curbing the mighty flaming ball,  
to give some rest for sunburnt lands  
and bring the plants' lifeblood: rainfall.  

One day my breath will leave to see  
the hills of white I so adore,  
up there, it won't be only me,  
but everyone I loved before.
