Right through this scruffy door,  
you'll find an empty space,  
once filled with joy and love,  
it was a happy place  

The walls had heard so much,  
of fun that once was here,  
when you press ears against  
them, laughs, I swear, appear  

The floors creak sligthly now,  
weary from all the days,  
when jumped, run they were on,  
when life went on its ways  

And through the windows sun  
looks down and searches for  
the people that it loved,  
to touch with rays before  

The empty air it warms,  
feels like a soft embrace,  
reminds you of the time,  
this was a happy place
