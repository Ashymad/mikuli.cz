One day with my window slightly ajar,  
I sat, inside has fallen a star,  
Right on my lap it landed,  
Right to my heart it bonded.  

I said to the little star: "Why me?",  
For most of my life I just drunk tea,  
Alone, with cats and books and sounds,  
A stone has life more worth applauds.  

The star just looked at me confused,  
And felt the warmth of what had fused  
With her, engulfed her familiar pain,  
Bothered not she had to feel again
