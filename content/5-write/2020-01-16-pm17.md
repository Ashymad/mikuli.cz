Clock slowly moves its hands around,  
I often try to look elsewhere,  
The night ends soon, sun is abound,  
This thought I really cannot bear  

The future filled by emptiness,  
as always, yet so different,  
out of the floor creeps loneliness,  
stops being caught in the moment  

I grasp the air but nothing's there,  
I look around, but still can't see,  
old life must be somewhere out there,  
just please, god, bring it back to me  

Clock slowly moves its hands around,  
my eyes stare how they fly so fast,  
I drift away, with nothing found,  
to stop my longing for the past
