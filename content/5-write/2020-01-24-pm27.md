A road ahead is clearly seen,  
a road tread by many before,  
it proved right for others of kin,  
but maybe there's even more?  

Maybe a bush, so nondescript,  
hides a fruit of unknown inside,  
the confines of the road feel strict,  
why them are what should i abide?  

The ground where now the damned road was,  
How had it shown a path back then?  
There was no border not to cross,  
But now it's like animal pen  

Just use your legs, stray from the line,  
no need to queue proven or not,  
i'm sure there's something to gain,  
explore, there is to see a lot.
