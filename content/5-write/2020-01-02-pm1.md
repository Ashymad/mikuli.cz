I love the time of now,  
the time before the new  

I cannot grasp the how,  
the why, the what, the who  

But every time I draw,  
my friends and me and you  

Memory of what I saw,  
on paper has its view  

And though the time will go,  
and life will change it's hue  

The time of now i know,  
I'll love, before it's due
