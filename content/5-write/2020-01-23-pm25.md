A leaf is hurled and swriled with force,  
the wind shakes angrily longing  
to find out why, what is the source  
of all the pain, cause of mourning?  

Is it the trees that he caressed,  
is it the waves he raised and pushed,  
Is it the words he was so blessed  
to carry, by lovers uttered  

A leaf is torn apart, wind groans,  
can't do more now than flip a coin,  
his might erodes the sturdiest stones,  
but those apart he can't rejoin
