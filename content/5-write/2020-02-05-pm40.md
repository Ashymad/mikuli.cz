A breath flows right around,  
my head, some words follow it,  
meaning is lost, what's left the sound,  
say, did you hear the beat,  

of legs rustling fiercely,  
half eaten childish I screams,  
you shutups, cut air eerily,  
with giggles life forthcomes,  

squirms and envelops with,  
armsfull of colorful glee,  
huge rocks above sorround man's pith,  
unchanged for years to see
