I do not want to die,  
I say,  
I have so much,  
Of life to play  

Dance till the dawn,  
Kiss under stars,  
Read every book,  
Play ball on mars,  

Marry my love,  
Have big bright home,  
Spawn children too,  
Look at them grow,  

Have them hold me,  
On my last day,  
I do not want to die,  
I pray
