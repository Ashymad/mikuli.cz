The day was bright,  
as sun travelled,  
across the skies,  
towards the ground.  

It'll be alright,  
said tidy man,  
how free of woe,  
although screenbound  

So many died,  
whilst waiting for  
medical team's  
vechicle's sound  

But oh the might,  
of tidy men,  
that fight to make,  
their speech profound  

They think they're right,  
because they rule,  
long time ago,  
by vote were crowned  

But now the streets,  
are full of us,  
their blood will flow,  
their kin be drowned
