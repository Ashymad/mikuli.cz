Rule 1 - no life shall be disgraced  
Rule 2 - whence died stone shall be placed  
Rule 3 - dying shan't happen after six  
Rule 4 - water and oil cannot be mixed  
Rule 6 - the number 5 will be forlorn  
Rule 7 - kids must cry after they're born  
Rule 8 - sky has to appear blue  
Rule 9 - rule 8 shan't hold on Moon  
Rule 10 - if standing upside down,  
or reading through a mirror lens,  
the rules shall flip their meaning and  
shall have an elevated sense
