Out there, outside the glass,  
See? Behind that tree,  
wild flowers and green grass,  
Let's lay there, shall we?  

Or maybe on this house,  
the red one, you know  
we could sit with the crows,  
look at men below  

Oh, I know what to do,  
let's get a small ship,  
you, me, will be its crew,  
world will be it's trip  

We'll sail and ride and walk...  
Hmm? You want a snack?  
I should stop crazy talk?  
You're right let's go back
