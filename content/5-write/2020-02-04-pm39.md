Spikes grow out of my mouth,  
sharp needles shot on sight,  
I try to pick them out, but  
I cannot stop their growth  

I'm locked in the confines,  
of my defensive cage,  
the bars let through the spikes, though  
made to withhold a rage  

Words spoken hard slip in,  
stack up like books on shelves,  
built up inside the jail I  
lose sight of everyone else
